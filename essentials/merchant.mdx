Before you do anything, you have to set up a **Merchant Account** with us.

You can simply fill out the onboarding form here, or you can email david@joinmagic.co the below info:

1. Name of Company
2. Checkout Page URL

Checkout page URL is the URL of the site you want us to return to after the customer successfully or unsuccessfully completes their payment. Example of the page on a basic Shopify site is shown below:


We use this information to create a verified account for you that can freely accept payments and has a balance that you can easily draw money out of.


## Additional Info

If you're interested in the logistics behind why we need the information we list, feel free to reference the documentation available for our payment processor, Dwolla, and their guide for creating a business verified customer: [Dwolla Guide](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/business-verified-customer).
