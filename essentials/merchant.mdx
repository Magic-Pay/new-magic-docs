Set up a **Merchant Account** with us to start accepting payments with Magic!

This is the first step to integrate Magic on your online store page. You need to obtain Magic API keys that will be used to carry out purchases through Magic.

### üñäÔ∏è To obtain the Magic's API keys please make a sale contacts or email david@joinmagic.co. Below are examples of information we will need to successfully create a merchant account and enable Magic payment functionalities:

1. **Name of Company**
2. **Checkout Page URL** - The checkout page URL is the URL of the site you want us to return to after the customer successfully or unsuccessfully completes their payment. An example of the page on a basic Shopify site is shown [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0200/7466/files/credit-card-security-text.png?v=1594127681).
3. **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** - If you use Stripe Atlas, this is found on your dashboard.
4. **Funding Source/Bank Account Details** - To connect customers who pay to go to your bank account, we'll need a US-based bank account Account and routing Number.

We use this information to create a verified account for you that can freely accept payments and has a balance that you can easily draw money out of.

For more information, feel free to also book a quick [Integration Call](https://calendly.com/d/yxs-9bd-nkp/magic-intro-call-30-minute). 

## Next Steps

<Warning>

Once we have received this information, we will create a merchant account for you fairly quickly. Afterward, we will supply you with the API key and the Funding source ID which you would need for the integration.

</Warning>

<Warning>

Also, please make sure you store your API keys securely, as incorrect storage can be subject to malicious use, such as supplanting of business and bank transactions under a false identity.

</Warning>

Please refer to the next step of the process for development: **Setting up our ready-to-use Magic button**!
