Set up a **Merchant Account** with us to start accepting payments with Magic!

This is the first step to integrate Magic on your online store page. You need to obtain Magic API keys that will be used to carry out purchases through Magic.

### üñäÔ∏è To obtain the Magic's API keys please make a sale contact or email david@joinmagic.co including the info below:

1. **Name of Company**
2. **Checkout Page URL** - The checkout page URL is the URL of the site you want us to return to after the customer successfully or unsuccessfully completes their payment. An example of the page on a basic Shopify site is shown [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0200/7466/files/credit-card-security-text.png?v=1594127681).
3. **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** - If you use Stripe Atlas, this is found on your dashboard.
4. **Funding Source/Bank Account Details** - To connect customers who pay to go to your bank account, we'll need a US-based bank account Account and routing Number.

We use this information to create a verified account for you that can freely accept payments and has a balance that you can easily draw money out of.

## Next Steps

<Warning>

Once we have received this information, we will create a merchant account for you fairly quickly. Afterward, we will supply you with the API key and the Funding source ID which you would need for the integration.

</Warning>

<Warning>

Also make sure you store your API keys securelly since it can be used maliciously to supplant your business and make bank transactions using your identity.

</Warning>

Please refer to the next step of the process for development: **Setting up our ready-to-use Magic button**!
