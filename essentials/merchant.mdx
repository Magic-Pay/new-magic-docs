Before you do anything, you have to set up a **Merchant Account** with us.

üñäÔ∏è You can simply fill out the onboarding form here, or you can email david@joinmagic.co the below info:

1. **Name of Company**
2. **Checkout Page URL** - Checkout page URL is the URL of the site you want us to return to after the customer successfully or unsuccessfully completes their payment. Example of the page on a basic Shopify site is shown [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0200/7466/files/credit-card-security-text.png?v=1594127681).
3. **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** - If you use Stripe Atlas, this is found on your dashboard.
4. **Funding Source/Bank Account Deatils** - To connect customers who pay to go to your bank account, we'll need a US-based bank account Account & Routing Number.

We use this information to create a verified account for you that can freely accept payments and has a balance that you can easily draw money out of.

## Next Steps

After receiving this information, we'll be able to create a merchant account for you fairly instantly. **You should at that point receive API keys that will be crucial to your development process.**

Please refer to the next step of the process for development: Setting up with our NPM package!
