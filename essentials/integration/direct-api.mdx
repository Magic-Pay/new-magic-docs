A Direct API Integration with Magic is one of the options we provide. First, merchants will need an __API Key__, provided after we create their merchant account.

### 1. Create Checkout on Magic and get `Checkout ID`

- Once a consumer checks out and selects to __Pay with Magic__, the Merchant will need to get the `Checkout ID` from Magic.
- To create the `Checkout ID`, the Merchant will call [Create Checkout API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/create_checkout) from the  Merchant’s store. 
- The Merchant will have to create a call on their backend to our endpoint, which will generate the `Checkout ID`.
- At that point, the merchant will then pipe the data to the checkout object to be called by the `Magic Link Button` feature.
- The Merchant will pass the request parameters as given in [Create Checkout API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/create_checkout) and need to get and store a `Checkout ID`.

### 2. Retrieve the `Link Token` and then Finish Integrating with Magic!

- Once a merchant gets the `Checkout ID` from Magic, Magic will work with the Merchant to retrieve the `Link Token`.
- To retrieve the `Link Token`, the Merchant will hit one of our API endpoints: [Get Link Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/generate_link_token) from Merchant’s store.
- To populate the `Link Token`, we'll need the `Checkout ID` as generated in the last step, through this API call: [Get Link Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/generate_link_token).


### 3. Voila! With both the `Checkout ID` and `Link Token`, Integrate the Rest of the Magic SDK

- Find the [SDK integration](/essentials/integration/sdk) for more information.
- With both values, we can now use the `Magic Link` Button, where consumers can now easily pay with Magic. where it will process to authenticate consumers and allow consumers to interact with banks for payments.

### 4. Process your Very First Payment!

- On the Hosted Page, once the consumer clicks on the __Pay Now__ button in the last step of our flow, we'll trigger a payment.
- To process a payment, the Merchant can simply call the [Process Payment API](/api-reference/endpoint/payment_preprocess/get_processor_token) of Magic from the Merchant’s store.


### 5. Success And Error Page

Based on a successful or error payment response, the consumer will be redirected to the last URL before clicking the original Magic payment button.
