### The Magic NPM SDK is our easiest and most lightweight way to integrate the Magic product. It's instantly compatible with any Javascript-framework-based store. Look [above](https://magic-21.mintlify.app/essentials/npm) for how to integrate with our package!

The Magic SDK is an [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicpay/magicpay-js).

This __Magic Pay SDK__ has three components:
* [Magic Link button](#magic-link-button)(which will open our Hosted Page)
* [Marketing Component](#marketing-component)(Informational Screen)
* [Magic Button](#magic-button)(Consumer-facing "Pay" Button)


### Magic Link Button

This component, when clicked (on a merchant's store by a consumer), will open a "Hosted Page", which will essentially be where the consumer carries out the rest of their checkout process.

To use this feature, merchants need to pass a `Checkout ID` and `Link Token` for a particular checkout object and also need to pass an `Onsuccess` and `Onerror` function in which it will handle operation as given in the __Readme.md__ file of that package.

**Parameters**

___checkoutId___ : <blockquote> Pass obtained Checkout id From [Create Checkout API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/create_checkout) of Magic.</blockquote>

___linkToken___  : <blockquote> Pass obtained Link Token From [Get Link Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/generate_link_token) of Magic. </blockquote>

___onSuccess___  : <blockquote> Pass a function in which Merchant will call [Process Payment API](/api-reference/endpoint/payment_preprocess/get_processor_token) of Magic, this function will be called when consumer ads payment method and clicks on pay now button on the hosted page. </blockquote>

___onError___    : <blockquote> Pass a function in which Merchant will perform a custom action if there is any error on processing with bank or consumer, this function will be called when there is any error with adding payment method for authenticating consumer. </blockquote>

___isSandbox___  : <blockquote> Add this parameter if Merchant needs to use Magic in __Sandbox mode__. </blockquote>


### Marketing Component

Magic provides a marketing component to promote Magic's payment option in their store and inform the consumer about our security and trustworthiness.

Merchants can import it on the appropriate component and call the magic-info element as given in the __Readme.md__ file of the package.


### Magic Button

Magic provides a `Magic Button` that merchants can use as a "pay now" or a checkout button, similar to Affirm, Paypal, and other comparable alternative checkout buttons.

Merchants can import it on the appropriate component and call the magic-info element as given in the __Readme.md__ file of the package.
