### The Magic NPM SDK is our easiest and most lightweight way to integrate the Magic product. It's instantly compatible with any Javascript-framework-based store. Look above for how to integrate with our package!

The Magic SDK is a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicpay/magicpay-js). Merchants will install this package and it'll make it super easy for them to integrate our product!

This __Magic Pay SDK__ provide three components:
* [Magic Link button](#magic-link-button)(which will open hosted page)
* [Marketing Component](#marketing-component)(Magic Info)
* [Magic Button](#magic-button)(to handle any custom operation)


### Magic Link button

This component when clicked (on a merchant's store by a consumer) will open a "Hosted Page", which will essentially be where the consumer carries out the rest of their checkout process.

To use this feature, merchants need to pass a `Checkout ID` and `Link Token` for a particular checkout object and also need to pass an `Onsuccess` and `Onerror` function in which it will handle operation as given in the __Readme.md__ file of that package.

**Parameters**

___checkoutId___ : <blockquote> Pass obtained Checkout id From [Create Checkout API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/create_checkout) of Magic.</blockquote>

___linkToken___  : <blockquote> Pass obtained Link Token From [Get Link Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/generate_link_token) of Magic. </blockquote>

___onSuccess___  : <blockquote> Pass a function in which Merchant will call [Process Payment API](/api-reference/endpoint/payment_preprocess/get_processor_token) of Magic, this function will be called when consumer ads payment method and clicks on pay now button on the hosted page. </blockquote>

___onError___    : <blockquote> Pass a function in which Merchant will perform a custom action if there is any error on processing with bank or consumer, this function will be called when there is any error with adding payment method for authenticating consumer. </blockquote>

___isSandbox___  : <blockquote> Add this parameter if Merchant needs to use Magic in __Sandbox mode__. </blockquote>


### Marketing Component

Magic provides a marketing component to promote Magic payment on their store.

Merchants can import it on the appropriate component and call the magic-info element as given in the __Readme.md__ file of the package.


### Magic Button

Magic provides a magic button that merchants can use as a "pay now" or a checkout button, similar to Affirm, Paypal, and other comparable alternative checkout buttons.

Merchants can import it on the appropriate component and call the magic-info element as given in the __Readme.md__ file of the package.
