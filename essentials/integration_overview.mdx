### Integration Overview

Our Integration consists of two core steps:

1. [**Creating a Merchant Account with Magic**](https://magic-21.mintlify.app/essentials/merchant)
2. Implementing Magic as a Payment Method at Checkout:
    - [**Use Magic's ready-to-use button**](https://magic-21.mintlify.app/essentials/magic-button)
    - [**Create API endpoints to request Magic's API**](https://magic-21.mintlify.app/essentials/backend)
- _(Optional)_ **Incorporating Magic's Accounting Reports** into your financial operations.

### Consumer Journey

By integrating with Magic, merchants can offer customers a modern experience for paying by bank for subscription products. Below is an example of how consumers would use Magic!

1. Customers see information about Magic on a merchant's online store. This helps them learn more about who we are, what we do, and how we focus on keeping their details safe.
2. Customers choose the items they want and add them to their shopping cart.
3. When checking out, they can choose Magic as a way to pay.
4. Customers enter all the needed information for checkout on the merchant's page and then move forward to complete their purchase.
5. Magic then shows a secure payment page. Here, customers sign in to Magic and tell us which bank details we should use to pay for the order.
6. Once the customer confirms, they're taken to Magic's order confirmation page.
7. Customers click on the pay button in Magic. This information goes to the merchant's page. If everything is okay, the merchant asks Magic to get the payment, and we immediately move the money from the customer's bank account. If there's a problem, both the merchant and the customer are told about it.
8. All payments made with Magic are recorded, and merchants can easily check them whenever they want.
