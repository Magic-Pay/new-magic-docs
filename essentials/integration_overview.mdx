### Integration Types

Magic offers the following integrations:

* Direct API Integration with Native SDK
* NPM SDK Integration

### Integration Overview

Magic Payments integrations typically consist of the following key elements:

1. **Creating a Merchant Account with Magic**
2. **Implementing Magic as a Payment Method at Checkout** (Options: React Component, Hosted Page, Checkout ID, Link Token)
3. **Adding Magic Marketing Components** (as needed)
4. *(Future)* **Incorporating Magic's Accounting Reports** into your financial operations.

### Consumer Journey

By integrating with Magic, merchants can offer customers a modern experience for paying by bank for subscription products:

1. The customer sees Magic marketing on a merchant’s e-commerce site and can engage with it to learn more about Magic, our brand, and our emphasis on security.
2. The customer adds items to their cart and proceeds to checkout. 
3. On the checkout page, the customer can select Magic as their form of payment.
4. The customer provides all normally required checkout-related information to the merchant's frontend and clicks to complete their order.
5. Magic opens a hosted payment experience in which the consumer authenticates to Magic and confirms the bank information Magic should use to transfer the funds for the order to the merchant.
6. Magic confirms the customer’s request, and the customer is sent to the Magic’s order confirmation page.
7. The customer clicks on Magic's pay button, and the event is sent to Merchant’s frontend. When successful, the merchant confirms the purchase to process payment by calling Magic's API. Magic at that point instantly transfers the funds from the customer’s bank account. Otherwise, in the event of a failure, Magic lets the merchant and customer know.
8. Magic keeps a record of all transactions made through Magic, which can be easily accessible by the merchant.
