Because of the simplicity of our API, merchants can start or move extremely quickly from sandbox to production. Below are the steps needed to test the API, once integrated:

1. On the Hosted Page, once the consumer clicks on the __Pay Now__ button in the last step of our flow, we'll trigger a payment.
2. To process a payment, the Merchant can call Magic's [Process Payment API Endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/payment_preprocess/get_processor_token) from the Merchantâ€™s store. The consumer can call the API via the Hosted Page.
3. Consumers and Merchants can confirm the success of the transaction by reviewing the purchase success screen. Once the payment has been processed, Magic's API will notify you of its success or failure. Merchants can additionally verify this by checking the balance in their Funding Source wallet.
