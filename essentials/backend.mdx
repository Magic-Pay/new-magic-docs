## Setting up API endpoints to comunicate with Magic's API.

As mentioned in the previous section, in order to make your integration secure,
it is recomended to place all the communication with Magic's API on a backend
solution. It will hide your bussines logic and API keys from malicious
activities, ensuring a more secure integration. Your backend solution should
provide two endpoints to:

- Obtain the checkoutId and linkToken used by Magic Link
  Button.
- Complete a transaction using the banking data collected in the hosted page
  (frontend).

To implement such service you can use any technology that allows making HTTP
requests (e.g node, python, java, etc.). This documentation page contains code
snippets that serve as example of Django Views endpoints. Please refer to the official Django documentation for a better understanding, but you should be able to get a good idea on how this can be implemented using
any other technology.

For a fully functional example please refer to [this github repository](https://github.com/roj4s/magic-merchant-example)

### Getting the checkoutId and linkToken from Magic's API

In order to obtain the necessary parameters used by the Magic button we need to
create a **Checkout object** by making a `POST` request to Magic API `api/merchants/checkout`
endpoint. If it succeeds, the response from that request will include the
`checkoutId` of the newly created checkout object.

Once the `checkoutId` is obtained you can get the `linkToken` by making
a `POST` request to Magic API
`api/merchants/checkout/<checkout_id>/generate_link_token` endpoint. Make sure
to include the `checkoutId` on the url.

This process can be implemented using a Django view as follows:

````python checkoutview.py

from django.http import JsonResponse
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
import os
import requests


class CheckoutAPI(APIView):
    def post(self, req):
        magic_api_url = os.environ["MAGIC_URL"]
        magic_key = os.environ["MAGIC_API_KEY"]

        checkout_url = f"{magic_api_url}/api/merchants/checkout"

        checkout_resp = requests.post(
            checkout_url, json=req.data, headers={"api-key": magic_key}
        )

        if checkout_resp.status_code in (200, 201):
            checkout_data = checkout_resp.json()
            checkout_id = checkout_data["id"]
            link_token_url = f"{magic_api_url}/api/merchants/checkout/{checkout_id}/generate_link_token"
            link_token_resp = requests.get(
                link_token_url, headers={"api-key": magic_key}
            )

            if link_token_resp.status_code in (200, 201):
                return JsonResponse(link_token_resp.json())

        return Response(checkout_resp.content, status=400)
```````

### Use Magic API to complete a transaction

In the frontend, once all the banking data is gathered through the hosted page
it is time to complete the transaction. That is implemented on the `onSuccess`
callback explained in the previous section. Such callback should include
a request to an endpoint in the merchant's backend that will request Magic's API
to complete the transaction.

This endpoint can be implemented using a Django view as follows:

````python completetransactionview.py

from django.http import JsonResponse
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
import os
import requests

class CompleteCheckoutAPI(APIView):
    def get(self, req, checkout_id):
        magic_api_url = os.environ["MAGIC_URL"]
        magic_key = os.environ["MAGIC_API_KEY"]
        checkout_url = (
            f"{magic_api_url}/api/merchants/payment_preprocess/get_processor_token/"
        )
        checkout_resp = requests.post(
            checkout_url,
            json={checkout_id: checkout_id},
            headers={"api-key": magic_key},
        )

        checkout_data = checkout_resp.json()
        resp = JsonResponse(checkout_data)
        if checkout_resp.status_code not in (200, 201):
            resp.status_code = 400

        return JsonResponse(checkout_data)
```````

That will be all you need to successfully use Magic as a payment method. With
all put in place now is a good moment to test your solution.
