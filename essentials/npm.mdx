## Integrating with our NPM Package

At this point, you have already:
- Created a Merchant Account and have an auto-generated corresponding Funding Source ID
- Received your API keys from creating your account on the Django Dashboard

### First, Getting the Components

First and foremost, check out our npm package to download our Magic Payments SDK to easily use our product: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicpay/magicpay-js. Our NPM package is the easiest way to get up and running with Magic!

There are three parts to installing the NPM package and integrating the frontend components:
1. The React "Pay" Button Component, which will be the button that activates the "Magic Link"
2. The "Magic Link", which is a link, when activated, will open our hosted page, where the customer will link their bank account and complete the transaction with Magic's backend logic and payment processor
3. The Checkout ID and Link Token. These are both things that need to be generated at the time of checkout. The Link Token guarantees that the checkout is unique and that no fraudster can access your checkout at the same time. The Checkout ID verifies that your checkout is unique and is used to identify the customer's checkout.

The first command to run is to install our NPM package:
```
npm i @magicpay/magicpay-js
```

### Part 1: Implementing the React "Pay" Button Component 
As mentioned earlier, this is a simple React component that is compatible with any Javascript-based frontend. It's simply used as the point to activate the "Magic Link" product.

Below is a snippet of the code for the button. For the `handleButtonClick`, the user will activate the "Magic Link" to access the Hosted Page.
```javascript ReactComponent.js
import "@magicpay/magicpay-js";

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    console.log("Handle Button Click");
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <magic-btn onClick={handleButtonClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Part 2: Using the Magic Link Button

To use the Magic Link Feature, merchants need to pass a `Checkout ID` and `Link Token` for a particular checkout object and also need to pass an `Onsuccess` and `Onerror` function in which it will handle operation as given in the __Readme.md__ file of that package.

**Parameters**

- `checkoutId` : Pass obtained Checkout id From [Create Checkout API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/create_checkout) of Magic.

- `linkToken` : Pass obtained Link Token From [Get Link Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/generate_link_token) of Magic.

- `onSuccess` : Pass a function in which the Merchant will call [Process Payment API](/api-reference/endpoint/payment_preprocess/get_processor_token) of Magic, this function will be called when the consumer ads payment method and clicks on pay now button on the hosted page. That function is called the `sendEventToChild` function.

- `onError` : Pass a function in which the Merchant will perform a custom action if there is any error on processing with the bank or consumer, this function will be called when there is any error with adding a payment method for authenticating the consumer.

- `isSandbox` : Add this parameter if Merchant needs to use Magic in __Sandbox mode__.

For the `Checkout ID` and `Link Token` values, Magic will need to work with the Merchant to correctly route the Checkout ID values and Link Token values to the Link Button object when a consumer presses to pay.

```javascript MagicLinkButton.js
import "@magicpay/magicpay-js";
import {sendEventToChild} from "@magicpay/magicpay-js";

function App() {
  const link_token = "<example_magic_link_token>";
  const checkout_id = "<example_checkout_object_id>";
  const onError = (data) => {
    console.log("Error Occured: ", data);
  };
  const onSuccess = (data) => {
    console.log("Success: ", data);
    response = {
      'type': 'SUCCESS_RESPONSE',
      'message': 'successful',
    }
    sendEventToChild(response)
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <magic-link
        checkoutId={checkout_id}
        linkToken={link_token}
        onSuccess={onSuccess}
        onError={onError}
        isSandbox
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```


### Part 3: Magic Marketing Component

For consumers curious to learn more about Magic, we have a simple Javascript component next to the "Pay" Button Component that users can click to learn more about Magic.

```javascript InfoComponent.js
import "@magicpay/magicpay-js";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <magic-info />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
