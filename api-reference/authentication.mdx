## Credentials at a high-level

Magic assigns each merchant unique Public and Private API keys.

### Client-Side API Authentication
Providing your Public API key identifies your merchant account to Catch so that your account configuration is applied when Catch responds to your request.

### Server-Side API Authentication
All server-side requests must provide valid authentication credentials in their request headers. Server-side API requests require both a valid Public API key and a corresponding Private API key.

Magic's e-commerce platform partners must securely access this data and exclusively use each merchantâ€™s particular keys when performing requests on their behalf.

## Putting it Together: An Integration

Magic Pay has two types of users: a merchant and a consumer. Each user has to authenticate in a different way.

### API Token

Merchant
- As mentioned before, merchants have to receive a pair of API keys.
- Merchants onboarding can generate an API key from the Django Admin Panel while creating the "Merchant Object."


### Authentication Token

Consumer
- Consumers need two things to effectively use Magic: an authentication token when registering for Magic (made through Plaid), as well as a checkout ID that is unique to whichever unique time they're purchasing a product at the merchant's store.
- Generally, an authentication token is made whenever a consumer creates an account with Magic using their phone number.
- A merchant will have to auto-generate a checkout ID for each consumer when they checkout with the Magic product. This is tied into the backend and will be featured again later.
