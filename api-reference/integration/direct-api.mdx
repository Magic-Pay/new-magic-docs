First merchant will need an __Api key__ that is provided when the merchant will get after __subscription__ with magic.


### 1. Create Checkout on Magic and get Checkout id

Once a consumer checks out with order and selects to __Pay with Magic__, Merchant will need to get checkout Id from Magic, and for that Merchant need to call [Create Checkout API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/create_checkout) from Merchant’s store.

In this step, Merchant will need to pass request parameters as given in [Create Checkout API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/create_checkout) and need to get and store a checkout id.


### 2. Get link token to to process with Magic SDK

Once a merchant gets the checkout id from Magic, then Merchant needs to get a Link token for that checkout object.
And for that Merchant needs to call [Get Link Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/generate_link_token) from Merchant’s store.

In this step, merchants will need to pass the obtained checkout id as given in [Get Link Token API](/api-reference/endpoint/checkout/generate_link_token) and need to get and store a link token.


### 3. Pass Checkout id and Link token to Magic SDK

Now to open the __hosted page of Magic__, On merchant’s Frontend, Merchant needs to integrate Magic SDK, Follow [SDK integration](/api-reference/integration/sdk) steps for that.
 
And for this step, merchants need to pass that stored link token and checkout id to SDK as given in [SDK Integration](/api-reference/integration/sdk) and it will launch the Magic screen where it will process to authenticate consumers and allows consumers to interact with banks for payments.


### 4. Process Payment

On the Hosted page, once the consumer clicks on the __Pay Now__ button, it will send the Success event to the Merchant store, where it will call the Success function that is initialized as given in [SDK integration](/api-reference/integration/sdk).

On that Function Merchant will need to call the [Process Payment API](/api-reference/endpoint/payment_preprocess/get_processor_token) of Magic from Merchant’s store.

And according to success and error response, merchants will need to call functions with formatted responses as given in [SDK integration](/api-reference/integration/sdk).


### 5. Success And Error Page

Based on payment response, Consumer will be redirected to Success/Error page on hosted page and After sometime it will close hosted page and will be redirected to Merchant’s store.
