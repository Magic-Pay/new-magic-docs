# Integration Overview

Welcome to Magic Payments integration, where you can seamlessly accept payments in a hassle-free manner. This integration process involves several key components, making it a comprehensive solution for your payment needs. Below, we'll provide an overview of the integration journey, starting from creating a merchant account to initiating transactions and handling refunds.

## Integration Components Overview

Magic Payments integrations typically consist of the following key elements:

1. **Creating a Merchant Account with Magic**
2. **Implementing Magic as a Payment Method at Checkout** (Options: React Component, Hosted Page, Checkout ID, Link Token)
3. **Adding Magic Marketing Components** (as needed)
4. *(Future)* **Incorporating Magic's Accounting Reports** into your financial operations.

## Steps for Integration

### Create Merchant Account

Begin by creating a merchant account from the Django admin panel. This step is crucial for initiating the integration process. During this process:

- Register the merchant on Dwolla by utilizing the "Register on Dwolla" button within the merchant object.
- Generate API keys that will be used in various API calls. Ensure you securely store these keys for future use.

### Integrate Frontend

Now, let's delve into the frontend integration to enhance the user experience.

#### Creating a Checkout ID

- Create a checkout object using the "merchants/checkout" POST API.
- A successful creation will result in a status code of 200 or 201.
- In the API response, you will receive a checkout object ID, which plays a pivotal role in tracking specific checkout transactions.
- Don't forget to set "is_subscription" to true in the checkout object to enable consumer user subscriptions.

#### Authenticate Consumer Users

To ensure user authenticity, employ the following APIs:

- **send_code API:** Validate and send a verification code to the user's phone number.
- **verify_code API:** Verify the received verification code, resulting in a 200 response and an authentication token.

#### Generate Link Token

After authenticating the user, use the "generate_link_token" API to:

- Register the merchant user on Dwolla.
- Store the token obtained in the success response for future reference.

### Our API Endpoints

Here's a summary of the essential API endpoints in this integration:

#### Creating a Checkout ID

- Create a checkout object using the "merchants/checkout" POST API.
- Successful creation results in a status code of 200 or 201.
- Receive a checkout object ID in the response.
- Set "is_subscription" to true for consumer user subscriptions.

#### Authenticate Consumer Users

- Use the "send_code" API to validate and send verification codes to user phone numbers.
- Employ the "verify_code" API to verify the received codes and obtain an authentication token.

#### Generate Link Token

- Use the "generate_link_token" API to register merchant users on Dwolla.
- Store the obtained token for future use.

### Create Link Token

To register consumer users on Dwolla, you can create a link token using the "create_link_token" API.

## Link Payment Method

Once consumer users are registered on Dwolla, it's time to link their payment methods to your checkout object. Utilize the "exchange_public_token" API for this purpose.

### Initiate Transaction

For initiating transactions, utilize the "get_processor_token" API, which consists of three internal parts:

1. **Get Processor Token from Plaid for Dwolla**
2. **Add Funding Source on Dwolla for Customer Bank Account**
3. **Initiate A2A Transfer and Store Transfer Information in Checkout Object**

### Refund Request

Consumer users have the ability to create refund requests using the "consumer_refund_request" API.

## Merchant Response on Refund Request

Merchants play a pivotal role in the refund process by approving or rejecting refund requests through the "merchant_status_refund_request" API.

### Initiate Refund

After merchant approval of a refund request, you can efficiently transfer funds from the merchant's account to the consumer's account using the "initiate_refund_transfer" API.

This comprehensive integration process ensures a smooth payment experience, covering everything from user authentication to refunds. Please refer to our detailed documentation for step-by-step instructions on each component.
