Magic is a payments-based e-commerce platform. Our payment gateway has an SDK that allows you to navigate an integration with us easily.

To browse this documentation, feel free to first get a taster of our documentation and the terminology you'll need in this "Introduction" section.

To get an integration going quickly, visit our "Get Started" section. Our integration only has two steps to integrate our product.

Finally, visit our API Reference for questions on how our core platform works and try some things out during or after your integration as you'd like.
